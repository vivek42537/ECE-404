THE PLAINTEXT QUOTE:

Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't go to yours.

- Yogi Berra

THE ENCRYPTION KEY:

30053

EXPLANATION:

A large chunk of the code in cryptBreak.py was taken and adapted from the Lecture 2 notes. 
Essesntially what the code is doing is looping through keys in betwee 0 and 2^16.
We were given that since the blocksize is 16 than our keyspace size would be a max of 2^16. 
In order to find the key and correct plaintext, every key in the loop was plugged in and using the 
various XOR operations it would try to decrypt the file. Once a decryption included "Yogi Berra"
it was assumed to be the correct key and plaintext.
